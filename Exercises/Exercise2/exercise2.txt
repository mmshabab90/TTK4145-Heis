EXERCISE 2

Theory:
Atomic operation: An operation that is executed in its entirety without other parallel execution threads affecting it.
Semaphore: A variable that controls access by parallel processes to a shared resource.
Mutex / mutual exclusion: Making sure that no concurrent processes access shared resources at the same time.
Critical section: Parts of code that access a shared resource (that should not be accessed by more than one thread at a time).
